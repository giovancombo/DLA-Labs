Generated text: The main goal in life is love and joy, and in death what are we left with? And when you have found your balance (so you don't die with the knowledge of death, so you know when to move on), then the most pressing question is where to focus yourself; not in the afterlife but where you actually end up, which is nowhere near that far for me. So what do it take for you to start living life as well as you would in another world? For me, it's always been the pursuit

Generated text: The main goal in life is to be as creative as possible in your career – so to see this as fulfilling when you can do so without procrastinating, isn't that amazing?

Generated text: The main goal in life is to create the most interesting person in the world in you that everyone can play with. To live this life where people don't care about you if you are going to die that makes any sense. It will take you for them and the person they care for and so on. Life is too simple to go back to.
