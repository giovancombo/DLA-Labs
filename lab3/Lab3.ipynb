    "+ A simple 2D environment with a (limited) number of *obstacles* and a single *goal* is presented to the agent, which must learn how to navigate to the goal without hitting any obstacles.\n",
    "+ The agent *observes* the environment via a set of 16 rays cast uniformly which return the distance to the first obstacle encountered, as well as the distance and direction to the goal.\n",
    "+ The agent has three possible actions: `ROTATE LEFT`, `ROTATE RIGHT`, or `MOVE FORWARD`.\n",

    "+ +100 if hitting the goal (episode ends)\n",
